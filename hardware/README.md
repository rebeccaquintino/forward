# Forward Converter Hardware Design

This folder contains all the necessary files and documentation related to the hardware design and implementation of the Forward Converter project.

## Folder Structure:

* **`_Previews/`**: Contains various preview images, renderings, or snapshots of the PCB layout, 3D models, or other hardware aspects.
* **`fabrication/`**: Includes all the final files required for manufacturing the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), such as Gerber files, drill files, pick-and-place files, and bill of materials (BOM).
* **`History/`**: Stores previous versions or snapshots of the hardware design files, allowing for tracking changes and reverting to earlier states.
* **`libraries/`**: Contains custom or project-specific component libraries (e.g., Altium libraries for footprints, 3D models, and schematic symbols) used in the PCB design.
* **`outputs/`**: Contains generated output files from the PCB design software, such as PDFs of schematics, assembly drawings, or other production-ready documentation.
* **`source/`**: Holds the primary source files for the hardware design, including the main Altium Designer project files (e.g., schematics and PCB layout).
    * `Forward_Project.PrjPcb`: The main Altium Designer PCB project file.
    * `Forward_Project.PrjPcbStructure`: Related project structure file for Altium Designer.
